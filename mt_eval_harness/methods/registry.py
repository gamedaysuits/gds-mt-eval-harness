"""
Registry for consumer-reports MT system adapters.

Maps stable method NAMES (the same vocabulary the Champollion CLI uses:
"google-translate", "deepl", "microsoft-translator", "libretranslate") to
their adapter classes, and resolves a name to a ready-to-use instance.

This is the seam the later ``mt-eval run`` wiring will call: given
``--method google-translate`` (a NAME, not a plugin-dir path), look the name
up here to get a TranslationMethod instance. See the "remaining wiring"
notes in the task report for the exact runner/cli touch points.
