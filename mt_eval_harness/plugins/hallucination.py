"""
Hallucination Rate Detector — MetricPlugin for the test harness.

Detects translation outputs that contain fabricated information not present
in the source text. Hallucinations in MT include:
    - Length inflation (output massively longer than input)
    - Repetitive/looping output (degenerate decoding)
    - Source echo (output is identical to input — no translation occurred)
    - Named entity fabrication (entities in output not in source)

Design:
    - All heuristics are deterministic and stdlib-only (re, collections).
    - Returns hallucination_rate on 0.0–1.0 scale (lower = better).
    - scoring.py inverts this: 0% hallucination → 1.0 (perfect).

Dependencies: Python stdlib only.

Source: SCORING_SPEC.md §4.3 — weighted 0.05 in both Profile A and B.

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Design Justification & Validation Status
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# VALIDATION STATUS: NOT HUMAN-VALIDATED
#
# These heuristics have NOT been validated against human hallucination
# judgments. They are engineering heuristics designed to catch gross
# failure modes observed in LLM MT output:
#
#   - Length inflation: NMT/LLM systems sometimes produce vastly longer
#     output than the source (degenerate beam search, repetitive padding).
#     Weight: 0.40 — highest because extreme length ratio is the cheapest
#     and most reliable hallucination signal (Raunak et al., 2021).
#
#   - Repetition: Looping decoder output ("the the the...") is a known
#     failure mode of autoregressive models. Weight: 0.30 — second highest
#     because n-gram repetition is unambiguous when present.
#
#   - Entity mismatch: Fabricated named entities are a hallucination type
#     documented in Guerreiro et al. (2023). Weight: 0.20 — lower because
#     our capitalization-based NER proxy has high false-positive rate,
#     especially for Cree (which has different capitalization conventions).
#
#   - Source echo: Model returns the source text unchanged — no translation
#     occurred. Weight: 0.10 — lowest because this is easily caught by
#     other metrics (exact_match_rate = 0, code_switching_rate ≈ 1.0).
#
# KNOWN LIMITATIONS:
#   - Cannot detect subtle semantic hallucinations (plausible but wrong
#     translations). This requires embedding-based methods (COMET-QE,
#     LABSE cross-lingual similarity) or LLM cross-checking.
#   - Entity mismatch uses capitalization as a proxy for NER — this will
#     miss hallucinated entities in non-Latin scripts and false-fire on
#     sentence-initial words.
#   - The 0.4/0.3/0.2/0.1 weights are engineering judgment, not empirically
#     derived. They should be recalibrated against labeled hallucination
#     data when available.
#
# UPGRADE PATH:
#   To add SOTA hallucination detection, implement a new plugin (e.g.,
#   EmbeddingHallucinationPlugin) that uses cross-lingual embeddings.
#   The MetricPlugin protocol supports multiple hallucination detectors
#   running in parallel — the scoring spec can be updated to prefer the
#   embedding-based detector when available.
