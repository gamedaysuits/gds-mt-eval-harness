MetricPlugin Protocol — Register custom evaluation metrics.

The test harness ships with generic metrics (exact match, chrF++, BLEU).
Language-specific metrics (morphological validation, linting, semantic
overlap) are registered as MetricPlugin instances by the consuming project.

Example:
    class MorphologyMetric:
        name = "morphology"

        def compute(self, entry: dict) -> dict:
            predicted = entry.get("predicted", "")
            words = predicted.split()
            valid = sum(1 for w in words if my_analyzer.check(w))
            return {
                "morph_total_words": len(words),
                "morph_valid_words": valid,
                "morph_validity_rate": valid / max(len(words), 1),
            }

        def aggregate(self, entry_results: list[dict]) -> dict:
            rates = [r["morph_validity_rate"] for r in entry_results]
            return {"avg_morph_validity": sum(rates) / max(len(rates), 1)}
