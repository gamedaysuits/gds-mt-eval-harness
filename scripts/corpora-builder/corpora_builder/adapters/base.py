"""
Abstract base class for source adapters.

Every data source (Tatoeba, OPUS, CSV, etc.) implements this interface
to fetch and parse parallel text entries. The adapter pattern isolates
source-specific download logic, authentication, parsing, and error
handling behind a uniform API.

Design decisions:
    - ``SourceAdapter`` is an ABC rather than a Protocol because adapters
      carry state (``name``, ``license``) and we want to enforce that
      subclasses declare these attributes. Protocols are better for
      structural subtyping of method signatures; ABCs are better when
      you also need required attributes and want clear error messages
      at class definition time (not at call site).
    - ``RawEntry`` is deliberately minimal — just the parallel texts,
      a source ID, and a metadata dict. All downstream enrichment
      (domain classification, difficulty estimation) happens in the
      pipeline, not in the adapter. This keeps adapters focused on
      one job: fetching data.
    - ``fetch()`` returns a plain list rather than a generator because
      most sources return bounded datasets (a few thousand entries max),
      and the pipeline needs random access for stratified sampling.
