Difficulty tier estimation for parallel text entries.

Assigns a difficulty tier (1–5) to each source sentence based on
surface-level linguistic features. This is deliberately a heuristic
estimator rather than a learned model, because:

    1. The features that drive translation difficulty (sentence length,
       clause count, vocabulary complexity) are well-approximated by
       simple surface heuristics for the kind of text in our corpora.
    2. Reproducibility: the same input always produces the same tier,
       with no model weights or random initialization involved.
    3. Zero dependencies: runs on the standard library alone.

The three features used:
    - **Word count**: The most reliable single predictor of translation
      difficulty. Longer sentences have more opportunities for reordering,
      agreement errors, and ambiguity.
    - **Clause count** (estimated): Approximated by counting commas,
      semicolons, and coordinating/subordinating conjunctions. This is
      a rough proxy — it overcounts in lists and undercounts in long
      clauses without punctuation — but it's good enough for binning
      into 5 tiers.
    - **Average word length**: A proxy for vocabulary complexity.
      Longer words tend to be more specialized (e.g. "contraindication"
      vs "pill"). This is language-dependent and works best for English;
      for agglutinative languages it's less meaningful, but since we
      classify based on the English source text, it's adequate.
