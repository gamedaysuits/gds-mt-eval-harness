"""
Rule-based domain classification for parallel text entries.

Uses keyword-matching heuristics to assign one of 16 domain codes to
each corpus entry. This is intentionally rule-based rather than
ML-based because:

    1. The 16 domains are well-defined and keyword-separable for the
       kind of text found in Tatoeba and OPUS (short, topically clear).
    2. A rule-based classifier is fully deterministic — the same input
       always produces the same domain, which matters for reproducible
       corpus builds.
    3. Zero external dependencies. No models to download or GPU to provision.
    4. Easy to audit. Anyone can read the keyword lists and understand
       exactly why a sentence was classified a certain way.

Limitations:
    - Short ambiguous sentences may not match any keywords. The fallback
      domain is ``"conv"`` (conversational), which is a reasonable default
      for Tatoeba-style general sentences.
    - Keyword overlap between domains (e.g. "contract" in both legal and
      ecommerce) is resolved by whichever domain accumulates more total
      keyword matches.
