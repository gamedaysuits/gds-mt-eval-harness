"""Anti-collision spread for the community compute queue.

The public queue is a static, ranked JSON file with no claim-locking. When
many contributors run the donate flow (`mt-eval queue --budget`) at the same
moment, strict top-order selection hands every worker the identical items —
wasting donated compute on redundant runs of one (model, corpus) pair. The
spread layer (`_spread_order`) gives each worker a priority-weighted random
permutation so simultaneous workers fan out across the queue.

These tests pin three properties:
  1. Default (spread=False) behavior is byte-for-byte the old top-order
     selection — the shared selection vectors and the JS port depend on it.
  2. Spread still favors high-priority items (they run most often).
  3. Under mass concurrency, no single item is dogpiled ~100×.
