# From Benchmark to Daily Use: The Post-Editing Path

> **The short version.** A leaderboard score is not a product. The path from "this method scores 0.78" to "the band office publishes documents in the language every week" runs through exactly one workflow: the machine produces a draft, a fluent speaker corrects it, and only the corrected text gets published. Every quality threshold in our specs is calibrated to that workflow — not to unsupervised machine output, which we do not endorse for any language on this platform.

People sometimes ask when a translation method will be "good enough to just use." For the languages this Arena serves, that question has a trap in it. The honest answer is that the bar worth aiming for is not "good enough to publish unreviewed" — it is **"good enough that reviewing a draft beats translating from scratch."** That bar is much lower, it is measurable, and crossing it changes what a community translation office can produce in a week.

## The workflow, end to end

```
 English source document
        │
        ▼
 Machine draft  ←  a benchmarked, community-owned method
        │
        ▼
 Fluent-speaker post-edit  ←  the human gate; nothing skips it
        │
        ▼
 Published text  ←  carries human approval, not a machine score
        │
        ▼
 (Optional, community-controlled) corrections become
 data that improves the next version of the method
```

Three things to notice:

1. **The machine never publishes.** The unit of output is a draft. The speaker's correction pass is not quality assurance bolted on at the end — it is the workflow.
2. **The speaker's time is the resource being optimized.** A method is better than another method exactly insofar as it leaves the speaker less to fix. Research on post-editing for well-resourced languages consistently finds it faster than translating from scratch at moderate MT quality (Plitt & Masselot 2010; Green, Heer & Manning 2013, both cited with links in [Translation Is Not Revitalization](/docs/perspectives/translation-is-not-revitalization)). Whether that holds for polysynthetic languages is precisely what the benchmark exists to find out — we treat it as a hypothesis to verify per language, not an assumption.
3. **The feedback loop is owned.** Every corrected document is potential training and coaching data — and it belongs to the community, to feed back (or not) on their terms under the [data sovereignty](/docs/sovereignty/data-sovereignty) rules. The feedback mechanism is a design goal of the platform, not yet a built feature; see [Reporting Errors and Owning Corrections](/docs/perspectives/reporting-errors-and-owning-corrections) for how corrections and provenance are meant to work.

## What the quality tiers mean for real use

The leaderboard scores methods on a composite of automated metrics ([Scoring Specification](/docs/specifications/scoring)), and the scores map to named tiers. Here is the honest translation of those tiers into daily-use terms:

| Tier (composite) | What it means for the post-editing path |
|---|---|
| **Baseline** (0.00–0.30) | Not usable for anything. Output is largely not the target language. Useful only as a research floor. |
| **Emerging** (0.30–0.50) | Still not a drafting tool. Correct fragments appear, but a speaker would spend more time fixing than writing fresh. |
| **Functional** (0.50–0.70) | The first tier where post-editing *might* beat from-scratch translation for easy texts — worth piloting with a speaker, not worth depending on. Frequent morphological errors remain. |
| **Deployable** (0.70–0.85) | The target tier for the workflow above: drafts where most morphology is correct and a fluent speaker can correct meaningfully faster than retranslating. **"Deployable" means deployable *into a post-editing workflow* — never "publish without review."** |
| **Fluent** (0.85–1.00) | Approaching competent human translation; errors rare and minor. The review pass stays — it just gets faster. |

Two structural honesty rules sit on top of this table, straight from the [Benchmark Specification §5 and §7](/docs/specifications/benchmark#5-quality-tiers):

- **Automated tiers are provisional labels, not verdicts.** They are nominations for human review. The thresholds will be recalibrated as speaker validation data accumulates, and they may land differently for different languages.
- **No method can claim Deployable or above without community review.** A stratified sample of its output goes to bilingual speakers, who rate each translation *reject / gist / acceptable / excellent*. The governance organization — not the leaderboard — decides whether the method advances.

For comparison, the [Founder's Prize](/docs/specifications/prizes) threshold (composite ≥ 0.80, ≥99% morphologically valid words, ≥70% speaker-rated acceptable-or-better) describes a method whose remaining mistakes are *real-language errors* — wrong inflection, not fabricated words. That is what "a draft worth a speaker's time" looks like in numbers.

## From a winning method to a working office

Suppose a method clears those gates. The remaining steps are organizational, and they are specified rather than improvised:

1. **Ownership transfers.** The method's code becomes the property of the community's governance organization — the developer keeps attribution and publication rights ([Ownership Transfer](/docs/sovereignty/ownership-transfer)).
2. **The method becomes a service.** It is packaged as a plugin and served through the deployment platform, with the community controlling access, pricing, and permitted uses ([Deploy to Production](/docs/getting-started/deploy-to-production)).
3. **Translators plug it into their day.** A translation office points its existing document workflow at the method's API: source text in, draft out, post-edit, publish. The published text carries the translator's name and authority — the machine is a tool on their desk, like a dictionary.
4. **Revenue follows usage.** Outside developers who use the method pay metered rates, and 90% of that revenue flows to the governance organization ([The Economic Model](/docs/sovereignty/economic-model)) — which can fund more translator hours, closing the loop.

## Where this stands today

Plainly: the full path is specified end to end, and partially built. The evaluation harness, metrics, run cards, and public leaderboard exist; the Plains Cree development corpus and an active prize exist; the deployment platform exists. The community review interface, the evaluation sandbox, and the corrected-text feedback loop are specified but not yet operational — the specs mark them as planned, and so do we. No method has yet completed the entire journey from benchmark to daily community use. That journey is the project's definition of success, which is exactly why we won't claim it early.

## What this means for you

:::info If you are a community member
A "Deployable" badge on a leaderboard never means a machine will publish in your language unsupervised — it means a draft generator may be ready to *audition* for your translators, on your terms, with your speakers as the judges (paid ones — see [How Speakers Get Paid](/docs/perspectives/how-speakers-get-paid)). If your community runs a translation office, the relevant question to bring to us is: "what would a pilot look like, and who reviews the output?"
:::

:::info If you are a researcher
The post-editing framing changes what is worth measuring: time-to-acceptable-text with a speaker in the loop, not just composite score. The Arena's metrics are proxies for that ([Scoring Specification §1](/docs/specifications/scoring)), and per-language post-editing studies for morphologically complex languages are an open research gap this infrastructure is designed to support.
:::

:::info If you are a builder
Optimize for the editor, not the metric. A method that produces real words with occasional wrong inflections is fixable in seconds by a speaker; a method that hallucinates plausible-looking forms poisons the whole workflow — which is why morphological validity is gated so hard here. Start at [Submit a Method](/docs/getting-started/submit-a-method), and read the [Method Interface](/docs/specifications/methods) for what you'll eventually hand over if you win.
