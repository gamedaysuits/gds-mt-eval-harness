# Evaluation Corpus Design Framework

> **Version:** 1.0  
> **Status:** Draft  
> **Purpose:** A systematic methodology for building evaluation corpora that produce valid, reliable, and linguistically meaningful translation quality assessments. This is the source of truth for how Champollion evaluation datasets are designed, constructed, and maintained.

---

## 1. Design Principles

### 1.1 — Why Not Public Benchmarks?

Public parallel corpora (FLORES+, Tatoeba, WMT test sets, OPUS) are available for development and debugging but are **excluded from official leaderboard evaluation**. The reason is straightforward:

**Contamination.** Frontier LLMs are trained on enormous web scrapes. Any parallel text that has existed publicly — especially in curated, widely-cited benchmark datasets — is likely in their training data. When you evaluate GPT-4o on FLORES+ and it scores 85 chrF++, you cannot distinguish "the model is good at translating" from "the model memorized these specific sentence pairs." This is not a theoretical concern — [research has demonstrated](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04850) measurable contamination effects on MT benchmarks.

For Champollion, this matters acutely because:
- Our leaderboard primarily compares LLM-based methods
- Our value proposition is *honest, rigorous evaluation*
- Our target users (language communities) make deployment decisions based on these scores

### 1.2 — Core Requirements

Every Champollion evaluation corpus must satisfy:

| Requirement | Rationale |
|-------------|-----------|
| **Human-authored** | No synthetic data. All source text and reference translations must be written by humans. LLMs may assist with alignment and formatting but never generate content. |
| **Not publicly available in parallel form** | The source text may be public; the reference translations may be public; but the specific *pairing* must not exist as a downloadable parallel corpus. |
| **Provenance-tracked** | Every entry must have documented origin: source document, translator, license, date. |
| **Linguistically informed** | Coverage must be guided by typological features, not random sampling. |
| **Domain-stratified** | Entries must span defined text domains with controlled representation. |
| **Difficulty-tiered** | Entries must be assigned difficulty tiers (1–5) based on structural complexity. |
| **Version-controlled** | Corpus versions are content-hashed. Scores are only comparable within the same version. |
| **Community-reviewable** | Reference translations must be reviewable by language community members. |

---

## 2. Source Text Selection

### 2.1 — Domain Taxonomy

Champollion evaluates translation for **practical deployment contexts**, not academic exercises. The domain taxonomy reflects real-world text types that translation users encounter:

| Domain | Code | Description | Example Sources |
|--------|------|-------------|-----------------|
| **Software UI** | `ui` | Button labels, menu items, error messages, tooltips, onboarding flows | Open-source app strings, documentation portals |
| **Official/Administrative** | `admin` | Government documents, legal notices, forms, policy statements | Public government publications, municipal documents |
| **Educational** | `edu` | Textbook content, lesson materials, instructional text | Published educational materials, teaching guides |
| **Narrative/Literary** | `lit` | Stories, cultural texts, oral history transcriptions | Published books, cultural archives (with permission) |
| **Conversational** | `conv` | Dialog, chat-like exchanges, informal written communication | Published dialog corpora, screenplays, interview transcripts |
| **Technical** | `tech` | API documentation, README files, technical specifications | Open-source project documentation |
| **Health/Medical** | `health` | Patient-facing medical information, public health messaging | Government health publications |
| **News/Journalistic** | `news` | News articles, press releases, current affairs | Community newspapers, Indigenous media outlets |

### 2.2 — Domain Distribution

A standard evaluation corpus should aim for the following distribution. The exact percentages may vary by language pair based on what text types are most relevant to the target community:

| Domain | Target % | Rationale |
|--------|----------|-----------|
| Software UI | 25% | Primary deployment context for champollion CLI users |
| Official/Administrative | 15% | High-stakes translation with legal implications |
| Educational | 15% | Core use case for language revitalization |
| Narrative/Literary | 10% | Tests cultural nuance and literary register |
| Conversational | 10% | Tests informal register and natural speech patterns |
| Technical | 10% | Tests precision and terminology consistency |
| Health/Medical | 10% | High-stakes, tests domain-specific vocabulary |
| News/Journalistic | 5% | Tests contemporary vocabulary and neutral register |

### 2.3 — Source Selection Criteria

When selecting source texts for a new corpus:

1. **License compatibility.** Source text must be under a license that permits use in an evaluation corpus. Prefer CC BY, CC BY-SA, or public domain. Document the license.

2. **Recency.** Prefer texts published within the last 10 years. Language evolves — especially vocabulary around technology, governance, and medicine.

3. **Register diversity.** Within each domain, seek texts at different formality levels. A government press release (formal) and a government social media post (informal) are both `admin` domain but different registers.

4. **Cultural relevance.** For Indigenous and minority languages, prioritize texts that matter to the community — land management documents, educational materials in the language, cultural preservation texts — over texts that happen to exist in parallel.

5. **No machine-translated sources.** If a "parallel" document was created by running the original through Google Translate and then post-editing, it is NOT acceptable as a reference translation. The reference must be an independent human translation.

---

## 3. Difficulty Tier System

### 3.1 — Tier Definitions

Every entry is assigned a difficulty tier (1–5) based on the structural complexity of the *source text*, not the translation difficulty (which varies by method).

| Tier | Label | Structural Characteristics |
|------|-------|---------------------------|
| 1 | **Elementary** | Simple sentences. Single clause. Present tense. Common vocabulary. No idioms. No embedded structures. |
| 2 | **Intermediate** | Compound sentences. Two clauses joined by conjunction. Past/future tense. Some domain vocabulary. |
| 3 | **Advanced** | Complex sentences. Subordinate clauses, relative clauses. Mixed tenses. Domain-specific terminology. Passive voice. |
| 4 | **Expert** | Multiple embedded clauses. Legal/technical register. Conditional structures. Abstract concepts. Cultural references. |
| 5 | **Extreme** | Dense prose with multiple simultaneous challenges: nested subordination, ambiguous pronoun reference, cultural idioms, mixed register, rare vocabulary. |

### 3.2 — Linguistically Informed Difficulty Factors

Beyond structural complexity, difficulty is modulated by **typological distance** between the source and target language. These factors are drawn from WALS typological features and the language card's classification data:

| Factor | Low Difficulty | High Difficulty |
|--------|---------------|-----------------|
| **Word order** | Same basic order (e.g., SVO→SVO) | Different basic order (e.g., SVO→SOV) |
| **Morphological type** | Similar type (e.g., analytic→analytic) | Different type (e.g., analytic→polysynthetic) |
| **Grammatical gender** | Same system or no gender | Source has no gender, target has complex gender |
| **Honorific/register** | No register marking | Target has complex register system (e.g., Japanese, Korean) |
| **Script** | Same script | Different script (transliteration required) |
| **Animacy** | No animacy distinction | Target has animacy-based agreement (e.g., Cree) |
| **Evidentiality** | No evidentiality | Target marks information source grammatically |

### 3.3 — Tier Distribution

A standard corpus should have approximately:

| Tier | Target % | Rationale |
|------|----------|-----------|
| 1 | 15% | Establishes baseline — even bad methods should handle these |
| 2 | 25% | Bread-and-butter practical translation |
| 3 | 30% | Where method quality differences become visible |
| 4 | 20% | Separates good methods from great ones |
| 5 | 10% | Ceiling test — very few methods will handle these well |

---

## 4. Reference Translation Quality

### 4.1 — Translator Requirements

Reference translations must be produced by humans who are:

1. **Fluent speakers** of the target language (L1 or equivalent)
2. **Literate** in both source and target language
3. **Domain-aware** for the domain of the text (a medical translator for health texts, etc.)
4. **Independent** — the translator must not have access to any MT output for the same text during translation

### 4.2 — Translation Brief

Every translator receives a brief that includes:

- The **register** to use (formal, conversational, etc.)
- The **target audience** (general public, specialists, children, etc.)
- Any **terminology conventions** specific to the language community
- Explicit instruction: "Translate the meaning, not the words. A natural-sounding translation is more valuable than a literal one."

### 4.3 — Quality Assurance

1. **Dual translation.** Ideally, each entry has two independent reference translations by different translators. Where this isn't feasible, prioritize dual translation for Tiers 4–5.

2. **Community review.** Reference translations should be reviewed by at least one additional speaker who did not produce the translation.

3. **Acceptable variants.** For each reference, document known acceptable variants (word order, orthographic conventions, dialectal forms). These feed the `equivalent_match_rate` metric.

### 4.4 — What Makes a Bad Reference

| Problem | Why It Invalidates Evaluation |
|---------|------------------------------|
| Machine-translated then post-edited | Post-editing preserves MT structure; penalizes methods that produce more natural translations |
| Translated by a learner, not a fluent speaker | Reference may contain errors that penalize correct MT output |
| Overly literal | Natural translations score poorly against literal references |
| Single valid interpretation for ambiguous source | Penalizes valid alternative interpretations |

## 5. Contamination Prevention

### 5.1 — The Contamination Threat Model

| Threat | Description | Mitigation |
|--------|-------------|------------|
| **Training data overlap** | LLMs trained on the parallel corpus | Don't publish the parallel corpus publicly |
| **Few-shot leakage** | Method author uses eval entries as few-shot examples | Fingerprint-check: entries in the prompt are detected and flagged |
| **Indirect contamination** | Source text exists in LLM training data (monolingual) | Acceptable — monolingual source text is expected. The *pairing* must be novel. |
| **Crowd contamination** | Community reviewers share entries publicly | License terms prohibit redistribution of the parallel corpus |

### 5.2 — Corpus Secrecy Tiers

| Tier | Visibility | Use |
|------|-----------|-----|
| **Public development set** | Fully public | Method development, debugging, regression testing. Scores NOT published to leaderboard. |
| **Held-out evaluation set** | Source text visible, references secret | Official leaderboard evaluation. Methods receive source text and return translations; scoring happens server-side. References are never exposed to the method. |
| **Gold-standard set** | Fully secret, community-controlled | Community-validated evaluation. Managed by governance organization. Used for "Community Validated" verification tier. |

### 5.3 — Rotation Policy

Evaluation corpora should be **rotated** periodically:

1. After a corpus has been in use for 12 months, begin constructing a replacement
2. Retire the old corpus to "development set" status (public)
3. Promote the new corpus to "held-out evaluation set"
4. This prevents gradual contamination through iterative optimization against a fixed target

## 6. Corpus Construction Workflow

### 6.1 — Step-by-Step Process

```
Step 1: Language Pair Selection
    └─ Identify target language, read language card
    └─ Review typological features (WALS), contact influences, scripts
    └─ Identify which difficulty factors apply

Step 2: Source Text Curation
    └─ Identify candidate source documents per domain
    └─ Verify licenses
    └─ Extract candidate sentences/segments
    └─ Classify by domain and preliminary difficulty tier

Step 3: Segment Selection
    └─ Sample segments to match domain distribution (§2.2)
    └─ Sample segments to match difficulty distribution (§3.3)
    └─ Ensure linguistic phenomenon coverage (§6.2)
    └─ Target minimum corpus size (§6.3)

Step 4: Reference Translation
    └─ Assign segments to qualified translators
    └─ Provide translation brief
    └─ Collect translations
    └─ Dual-translate Tier 4–5 entries

Step 5: Quality Assurance
    └─ Community review of references
    └─ Document acceptable variants
    └─ Flag and resolve disagreements

Step 6: Metadata & Packaging
    └─ Assign final difficulty tiers
    └─ Add provenance metadata per entry
    └─ Content-hash the corpus for versioning
    └─ Package as corpus JSON per harness spec

Step 7: Registration
    └─ Register in Supabase datasets table
    └─ Add to ATTRIBUTION.md if new sources used
    └─ Document in arena website
```

### 6.2 — Linguistic Phenomenon Coverage

Every corpus should include entries that test specific linguistic phenomena relevant to the language pair. These are drawn from the language card's `linguisticChallenges` and `contactInfluences` fields:

**Universal phenomena (all language pairs):**
- Pronoun resolution (ambiguous antecedents)
- Negation (single, double, scope)
- Quantifiers (all, some, none, most)
- Temporal expressions (relative dates, durations)
- Named entities (people, places, organizations)
- Numbers and measurements
- Lists and enumeration

**Pair-specific phenomena (from language card):**
- For polysynthetic targets: complex verb morphology, incorporation
- For gendered targets: gender agreement, neutral/inclusive reference
- For SOV targets: clause-final verbs, postpositions
- For tone languages: tone-dependent meaning distinctions
- For honorific languages: register markers, social context
- For contact languages: code-switching boundaries, loanword integration

### 6.3 — Minimum Corpus Size

Statistical reliability requires minimum entry counts. These are based on paired bootstrap confidence interval requirements (from `significance.py`):

| Purpose | Minimum Entries | Recommended |
|---------|-----------------|-------------|
| Development set | 50 | 100–200 |
| Held-out evaluation set | 100 | 200–500 |
| Gold-standard set | 200 | 500+ |
| Per-domain minimum | 10 | 25+ |
| Per-tier minimum | 10 | 20+ |

**Why 100 minimum for evaluation?** With fewer than ~100 entries, paired bootstrap significance tests (1,000 resamples) cannot reliably detect differences smaller than ~5 chrF++ points. With 200+ entries, we can detect ~2-point differences at p<0.05.

## 7. Corpus JSON Format

Every corpus entry follows the harness specification:

```json
{
  "id": "edtekla-dev-v1-042",
  "source": "The school board will meet on Tuesday to discuss the new curriculum.",
  "reference": "ᑭᓯᑭᓄᐦᐊᒫᑐᐏᓐ ᑲ ᐃᔑ ᐱᒥᐸᔨᐦᑕᐦᒃ ᑭᔅᑭᓄᐦᐊᒫᑐᐏᓇ ᐁ ᐃᔑ ᒫᒥᑐᓀᔨᐦᑕᐦᒃ ᐅᔥᑭ ᑭᔅᑭᓄᐦᐊᒫᑫᐏᓂᔭ ᓂᔓ ᑭᔑᑲᐤ",
  "acceptable_variants": [
    "ᑭᔅᑭᓄᐦᐊᒫᑐᐏᓐ ᓂᔓ ᑭᔑᑲᐤ ᑲ ᐃᔑ ᒫᒥᑐᓀᔨᐦᑕᐦᒃ ᐅᔥᑭ ᑭᔅᑭᓄᐦᐊᒫᑫᐏᓂᔭ"
  ],
  "domain": "edu",
  "difficulty": 3,
  "phenomena": ["temporal_expression", "named_entity", "future_tense"],
  "provenance": {
    "source_doc": "EdTeKLA Module 4, Unit 7",
    "source_license": "CC BY-NC-SA 4.0",
    "translator": "anonymous-speaker-001",
    "translator_qualification": "L1 Plains Cree, certified translator",
    "translation_date": "2025-11-15",
    "reviewer": "anonymous-speaker-002",
    "review_date": "2025-12-01"
  }
}
```

## 8. Anti-Gaming Measures

### 8.1 — Corpus Integrity

| Measure | Implementation |
|---------|----------------|
| **Content hashing** | Corpus version = SHA-256 of sorted entry IDs + references. Any modification produces a new version. |
| **Entry fingerprinting** | Each entry has a content-derived ID. If someone submits results against a modified corpus, the fingerprint won't match. |
| **Held-out enforcement** | For official evaluation, methods receive ONLY source text. References are never exposed. Scoring happens server-side. |
| **Rotation schedule** | Corpora rotate annually to prevent long-term optimization against a fixed target. |

### 8.2 — Submission Integrity

| Measure | Implementation |
|---------|----------------|
| **Deterministic fingerprint** | Run config (model, temperature, prompt, corpus version) is hashed. Identical configs produce identical fingerprints. |
| **Cherry-pick detection** | Submitters must disclose all runs, not just the best one. Multiple submissions with the same fingerprint are flagged. |
| **Contamination check** | If eval entries appear verbatim in the method's prompt or coaching data, the submission is disqualified. |

---

## 9. Existing Corpora

### 9.1 — EDTeKLA Development Set v1

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **ID** | `edtekla-dev-v1` |
| **Pair** | EN → CRK (Plains Cree, SRO) |
| **Entries** | 124 |
| **Domains** | Educational (100%) |
| **Tiers** | 1–5 (distribution TBD per entry audit) |
| **License** | CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 |
| **Status** | Development set (public) |

**Limitations:** Single domain (educational only). No domain stratification. Tier assignments may need audit. Small corpus size limits statistical power for significance testing.

### 9.2 — Planned Corpora

| Corpus | Pair | Status | Owner |
|--------|------|--------|-------|
| EN → TL (Filipino) custom corpus | EN → TL | Planned | Project owner |
| EN → CRK held-out set | EN → CRK | Future (needs community partner) | Community governance org |

---

## 10. Language Card Integration

The corpus framework integrates with the language card system:

1. **Domain selection** is informed by the card's `linguisticChallenges` — if a language has unique challenges (polysynthesis, tone, animacy), the corpus must include entries that test them.

2. **Difficulty calibration** uses the card's `classification` — typological distance between source and target families affects what constitutes "difficult."

3. **Register coverage** uses the card's `registers` — if a language has defined registers (formal-filipino, taglish-professional, taglish-casual), the corpus should include entries at each register level.

4. **Contact influence testing** uses the card's `contactInfluences` — for languages with heavy borrowing layers (Filipino: Spanish + English + Arabic), include entries that test whether methods handle loanwords correctly vs. over-translating them.

5. **Script handling** uses the card's `scripts[]` — for multi-script languages (Serbian: Cyrillic + Latin), include entries that test correct script selection.
