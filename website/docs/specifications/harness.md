# Eval Harness v2.0

> **Executive Summary.** This page covers installation, configuration, and usage of the MT evaluation harness — the tool that benchmarks translation methods against standardized corpora and produces scored run cards. For canonical definitions of metrics, schemas, and evaluation protocol, see the [Benchmark Specification](/docs/specifications/benchmark).

The harness runs translation experiments and produces run cards. It handles prompt construction, API calls, scoring, and result serialization — you supply the dataset and the model.

## Installation

**Requirements:** Python 3.10+

```bash
pip install sacrebleu aiohttp
```

Clone the harness repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/gamedaysuits/arena.git
cd arena
```

## Usage

```bash
mt-eval run --corpus path/to/dataset.json
```

This runs every entry in the corpus through the configured model (or method plugin), scores the outputs, and writes a run card JSON file to the output directory.

## Run Card Schema

Every experiment produces a **run card** — a self-contained JSON document. The top-level structure:

```json
{
  "run_id": "uuid-v4",
  "harness_version": "2.0",
  "model_slug": "google/gemini-3.1-pro",
  "model_id": "gemini-3.1-pro-001",
  "condition": "baseline",
  "timestamp": "2026-06-01T03:22:41Z",
  "elapsed_seconds": 142.7,
  "dataset": { ... },
  "config": { ... },
  "method_card": { ... },
  "system_prompt_sha256": "abc123...",
  "system_prompt_used": "You are a translator...",
  "fingerprint": { ... },
  "scores": { ... },
  "totals": { ... },
  "environment": { ... },
  "results": [ ... ],
  "run_card_hash": "sha256-of-entire-card"
}
```

See the [Run Card Specification](/docs/specifications/run-card) for the full schema with every field documented.

:::info Authoritative Schema
The [Benchmark Specification](/docs/specifications/benchmark) is the single source of truth for the run card schema. For metric definitions, composite weights, and quality tiers, see the [Scoring Specification](/docs/specifications/scoring). This page documents how to use the harness; the specs define what the outputs mean.
:::

### Key Blocks

**`dataset`** — Identifies which dataset was used, including its content hash so results are tied to a specific version:

```json
// Example using master_corpus.json (62 gold + 342 textbook = 404)
{
  "id": "edtekla-dev-v1",
  "version": "1.0",
  "language_pair": "EN→CRK",
  "sha256": "...",
  "entry_count": 404
}
```

**`scores`** — Aggregate metrics for the run:

```json
// Counts reflect the dataset used (here: master_corpus.json, 404 entries)
{
  "total": 404,
  "exact_matches": 12,
  "exact_match_rate": 0.0968,
  "fst_accepted": 87,
  "fst_acceptance_rate": 0.7016,
  "chrf_plus_plus": 42.31,
  "errors": 0,
  "avg_latency_seconds": 1.15,
  "median_latency_seconds": 1.02,
  "p95_latency_seconds": 2.34,
  "by_difficulty": { ... },
  "by_provenance": { ... }
}
```

**`totals`** — Token usage and cost tracking:

```json
{
  "prompt_tokens": 48200,
  "completion_tokens": 3100,
  "reasoning_tokens": 0,
  "cached_tokens": 12000,
  "total_cost_usd": 0.42,
  "cost_per_entry_usd": 0.0034,
  "reasoning_ratio": 0.0
}
```

## Writing-style and register metrics (informational)

The harness can evaluate whether translations match a target **register** and **writing style**, via the `WritingStyleConsistency` metric plugin (`mt_eval_harness/plugins/writing_style.py`). A translation can be linguistically correct but in the wrong register — informal phrasing in a legal document, formal boilerplate in marketing copy — and string metrics won't notice. These metrics do.

**What is measured (per entry):**

| Metric | Scale | Meaning |
|--------|-------|---------|
| `style_register_match` | boolean | Does the output match the expected register? The target comes from the corpus entry's `register` field (see [Benchmark Spec §2.6](/docs/specifications/benchmark)) or from a style profile |
| `style_sentence_length_ratio` | float | Predicted vs reference average sentence length (1.0 = match; divergence = style drift) |
| `style_formality_score` | 0.0–1.0 | Presence of formal/informal markers (T–V pronouns, contractions, …) using per-language marker resources |

**Aggregate:** `style_consistency_rate` — the fraction of entries with no detected register mismatch.

Enable a custom target with `--style-profile path/to/profile.json` (e.g. a brand-voice profile); without one, the plugin falls back to each corpus entry's `register` metadata where present.

:::caution Honest scoping
These metrics are **informational only** — they are never part of the composite score, and the formality detection is marker-based (a heuristic), not a learned judgment. Treat them as a drift detector for register adherence, not a verdict on style quality.
:::

## Fingerprint vs Run Card Hash

The harness produces two distinct hashes. They serve different purposes:

### Fingerprint

The **fingerprint** answers: *"Could this run be reproduced?"*

It hashes the combination of inputs that define the experiment configuration — not the outputs:

- Dataset SHA-256
- Model slug
- Condition label
- System prompt SHA-256
- Temperature
- Harness version

Two runs with identical fingerprints used the same setup. Their results should be comparable (modulo API non-determinism).

### Run Card Hash

The **run card hash** answers: *"Has this specific result file been tampered with?"*

It's the SHA-256 of the entire run card JSON (excluding the `run_card_hash` field itself). If any field changes — a score, a timestamp, a single output — the hash breaks.

:::info When to use which
Use the **fingerprint** to group comparable runs (same experiment, different executions). Use the **run card hash** to verify integrity of a specific result file.
:::

## Publishing to the Leaderboard

After completing a run, use `mt-eval publish` to submit the run card:

```bash
mt-eval publish eval/logs/harness/your-run-card.json
```

If no `--method-card` was provided during the run, `mt-eval publish` launches an interactive wizard (`method_card_wizard.py`) that walks you through describing your method (name, class, tools used, etc.). The wizard output is embedded in the run card before submission.

### Manual submission

Run cards are saved as JSON files in the output directory. You can also submit any run card file via the leaderboard UI at [/leaderboard](https://champollion.dev/leaderboard), or through the API:

```bash
curl -X POST https://champollion.dev/api/leaderboard/submit \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d @eval/logs/harness/your-run-card.json
```

:::warning Leaderboard validation
The leaderboard validates submitted run cards against the dataset registry. Submissions referencing unknown datasets, or with a broken `run_card_hash`, are rejected.
:::

:::danger DO NOT TRAIN on evaluation data
If your method has seen the evaluation dataset during development — as training data, few-shot examples, dictionary entries, or prompt engineering material — your submission will be **disqualified**. See [MT Evaluation](/docs/leaderboard/rules) for what makes a good vs. bad method.
